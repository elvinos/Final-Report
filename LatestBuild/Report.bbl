  Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) are gaining more and more attention in
  the current global energy landscape, thanks to some peculiar characteristics
  such as the versatility, modularity, scalability, fast response time, etc.
  BESSs can advantageously be used in the ancillary services market, in order
  to provide all the services necessary to ensure the stability and the
  reliability of the power system. Among other applications, BESS can also be
  used to shift electricity demand from on-peak to off-peak periods, also
  contributing to relieve peak demand charges, thus ensuring a saving for the
  customers. The BESS is charged when the electricity prices are the lowest
  (during the night) and discharged when the prices are the highest (during the
  daily hours), contemporary achieving a leveling of the daily usage pattern.
  This paper is the first of a two-part series, aiming to evaluate the economic
  feasibility of electrochemical storage systems in peak load shaving
  applications. The sizing and the operating strategy of the BESS are defined,
  so as to obtain, at the same time, the flattest daily usage pattern and the
  maximum benefit for the customer. A case study is analyzed, showing the
  modification of the power diagram when the BESS is added. The simulation
  results show a customer daily power profile perfectly leveled in shoulder
  seasons and a peak shaving effect in all other days.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Flattening household electricity demand reduces generation costs, since costs
  are disproportionately affected by peak demands. While the vast majority of
  household electrical loads are interactive and have little scheduling
  flexibility (TVs, microwaves, etc.), a substantial fraction of home energy
  use derives from background loads with some, albeit limited, flexibility.
  Examples of such devices include A/Cs, refrigerators, and dehumidifiers. In
  this paper, we study the extent to which a home is able to transparently
  flatten its electricity demand by scheduling only background loads with such
  flexibility. We propose a Least Slack First (LSF) scheduling algorithm for
  household loads, inspired by the well-known Earliest Deadline First
  algorithm. We then integrate the algorithm into Smart-Cap, a system we have
  built for monitoring and controlling electric loads in homes. To evaluate
  LSF, we collected power data at outlets, panels, and switches from a real
  home for 82 days. We use this data to drive simulations, as well as
  experiment with a real testbed implementation that uses similar background
  loads as our home. Our results indicate that LSF is most useful during peak
  usage periods that exhibit ``peaky'' behavior, where power deviates
  frequently and significantly from the average. For example, LSF decreases the
  average deviation from the mean power by over 20% across all 4-hour periods
  where the deviation is at least 400 watts.%

  An adaptive control method is proposed for applying ``peak shaving'' to the
  grid electrical demand of a single building, using a battery energy storage
  system to reduce the maximum demand. The objective is to save cost by
  reducing the monthly ``demand charges'' commonly levied on commercial power
  customers. Multiple demand forecasts are evaluated at every time step during
  each day, and combined to calculate a maximum limit to which the grid demand
  is controlled. Whereas prior methods apply peak shaving to every day alike,
  our method does not attempt to reduce peak demand below the maximum reached
  in the same month. The results show greater monthly demand cost reduction
  than a previously published method.%

  AbstractA microgrid that consists of distributed energy sources, such as
  micro turbines, wind turbines, fuel cells, and photovoltaic panels, storage
  devices and a group of radial load feeders are quickly rising in popularity
  in recent years. Because there are various controllable units in a microgrid,
  it has the potential to provide ancillary services (A/Ss) for the grid in the
  grid-connected mode. This article proposes a novel microgrid energy
  management strategy with demand response to provide peak shaving for the grid
  by using the peak-time rebate scheme. Under this scheme, various controllable
  units, such as controllable loads, battery storage, and diesel generators,
  participate voluntarily in the demand-response program to achieve maximum
  profit for the microgrid, so the microgrid can respond actively to the grid.
  The optimal energy management for the microgrid is achieved under this
  scheme. In addition, the main grid can benefit from the scheme with a lower
  cost compared with other traditional peak-shaving programs. Various incentive
  rewards of the peak-time rebate and demand-response levels of the
  controllable loads are discussed in the peak-time rebate scheme. The results
  demonstrate that the peak power of the grid tie-line is shaved markedly while
  achieving optimal energy management.%

  Smart grids heavily depend on communication in order to coordinate the
  generation, distribution, and consumption of energy-even more so if
  distributed power plants based on renewable energies are taken into account.
  Given the variety of communication partners, a heterogeneous network
  infrastructure consisting of IP-based and suitable field-level networks is
  the most appropriate solution. This paper investigates such a two-tier
  infrastructure and possible field-level networks with particular attention to
  metering and supervisory control and data acquisition applications. For the
  problem of network integration, a combination of gateway and tunneling
  solutions is proposed which allows a semitransparent end-to-end connection
  between application servers and field nodes. The feasibility of the approach
  and implementation details are discussed at the example of powerline
  communication and IP-based networks investigated in the European research
  project on real-time energy management via powerlines and internet.
  Nevertheless, it is shown that the communication architecture is versatile
  enough to serve as a generic solution for smart grids.%

  This paper is the second of a two-part series, aiming to evaluate the
  economic feasibility of electrochemical storage systems in peak load shaving
  applications. The battery energy storage system (BESS) is considered to be
  added to a private facility, with the aim of reducing the customer
  electricity bill. The BESS is charged during the night, when the electricity
  prices are the lowest and discharged during the daily hours, when the prices
  are the highest, contemporary achieving a leveling of the daily usage
  pattern. The economical evaluations are carried out considering four
  different electrochemical technologies: lithium-ion (li-ion), advanced
  lead-acid, sodium-sulphur (NaS) and flow batteries. First, the total costs
  and savings are estimated, calculating the net present value (NPV) and the
  internal rate of return (IRR) for each BESS technology. The economic indexes
  are calculated referring both to 2015 and to the estimated 2020 BESS prices.
  Second, a parametric analysis is carried out to investigate the effect of
  several parameters on the economic feasibility of installing a BESS. The
  considered parameters are: i) the gap between high and low electricity
  prices; ii) the peak demand charges; iii) the BESS investment costs. The
  economic analysis reveals that none of the BESS technologies are cost
  effective at the current BESS prices, without incentives, but the situation
  could already change in 2020 thanks to the sharp cost decline expected in the
  coming years.%

  Since the hourly spot market price is available one day ahead, the price
  could be transferred to the consumers and they may have some motivations to
  install an energy storage system in order to save their energy costs. This
  paper presents an optimal operation strategy for a battery energy storage
  system (BESS) in relation to the real-time electricity price in order to
  achieve the maximum profits of the BESS. The western Danish power system,
  which is currently the grid area in the world that has the largest share of
  wind power in its generation profiles and may represent the future of
  electricity markets in some ways, is chosen as the studied power system in
  this paper. Two kinds of BESS, based on polysulfide-bromine (PSB) and
  vanadium redox (VRB) battery technologies, are studies in the paper.
  Simulation results show, that the proposed optimal operation strategy is an
  effective measure to achieve maximum profits of the BESS. The results also
  show that it will take longer time to return the original investment of the
  VRB battery. So the PSB battery is the better investment choice for the time
  being.%

  Abstract Three phase battery energy storage (BES) installed in the
  residential low voltage (LV) distribution network can provide functions such
  as peak shaving and valley filling (i.e. charge when demand is low and
  discharge when demand is high), load balancing (i.e. charge more from phases
  with lower loads and discharge more to phases with higher loads) and
  management of distributed renewable energy generation (i.e. charge when
  rooftop solar photovoltaics are generating). To accrue and enable these
  functions an intelligent scheduling system was developed. The scheduling
  system can reliably schedule the charge and discharge cycles and operate the
  \{BES\} in real time. The scheduling system is composed of three integrated
  modules: (1) a load forecast system to generate next-day load profile
  forecasts; (2) a scheduler to derive an initial charge and discharge schedule
  based on load profile forecasts; and (3) an online control algorithm to
  mitigate forecast error through continuous schedule adjustments. The
  scheduling system was applied to an \{LV\} distribution network servicing 128
  residential customers located in an urban region of South East Queensland,
  Australia.%

  Prompted by technical issues that have arisen due to the widespread
  deployment of distributed intermittent renewable generators, rapidly rising
  peak demand and reductions in battery price, the use of battery-based energy
  storage systems in power networks is on the rise. While battery-based energy
  storage has the potential to deliver technical benefits, the best possible
  sizing, location and usage govern the financial viability. The objective of
  this study is twofold. Firstly, a generalised approach is proposed to model
  network upgrade deferral as a function of load growth rate, renewable
  generation penetration and peak shave fraction. This model is then used for
  the formulation of an optimisation problem which benefits from multi-period
  power flow analysis to co-optimise battery size, location, charge/discharge
  profile for a pre-specified number of units to be deployed in a given
  distribution network. The proposed approach is implemented using the generic
  algebraic modelling system platform and validated on an Australian medium
  voltage distribution network under multiple practical and potential future
  scenarios.%

  Abstract This paper addresses the problems of output power distribution and
  variability of small wind turbines. The aim of the study was to increase the
  share of locally consumed renewable energy and decrease power fluctuation in
  residential houses that meet their energy demand using wind energy. A system
  with shiftable water heating and decreased inverter power, which avoids
  unnecessary conversion steps for shifting of power peaks is proposed.
  Autocorrelation functions were used to analyse the energy consumption and
  production patterns for optimization of the inverter and hot water storage
  tank size for load shifting. The optimal sizing of these components for
  applying the method was found for different wind conditions. The results of
  simulations with high temporal resolution data and experiments showed that
  the proposed system is able to shave stochastic power peaks and shift
  electrical loads. The analysis of net energy flow revealed that the renewable
  energy cover factors can be enhanced by 14.4--36.0% and the wind turbine's
  nominal inverter power can be decreased down to 29.2--52.3% without
  increasing the system's energy losses or changing the hot water consumption
  pattern.%

  a motor plant in Westville, Oklahoma by working with the local electricity
  supplier (Ozarks Electric Cooperative Corp) and practicing peak shaving
  during summer months. After the plant had adopted all current energy saving
  methods such as use of NEMA Premium{\texttrademark} electric motors,

  Battery-based energy storage (BESS) has found to have potential and interest
  in reducing the peak demand. Over the years, a number of control strategies
  have been developed for BESS to reduce the peak demand. The control
  strategies are however complex and confined to simulation evaluation only.
  The control strategies are also not tested in BESS set-up with limited
  capacity. A simple and yet comprehensive real-time active peak demand
  reduction control has therefore been developed and presented in this paper.
  The real-time active control has been evaluated experimentally using the
  university building as the site. The performance of the real-time control has
  been evaluated as compared to the fundamental control as well as the ideal
  reduction in simulation. Even though the capacity is limited, the results
  showed superiority and adoptability of the real-time active control as
  compared to the fundamental control, with peak demand reduction of about
  8.64% as compared to 4.24%. The real-time active control also showed higher
  accuracy of 70.52% towards the ideal reduction result as compared to the
  fundamental control with only 35.25%. &copy; 2016 Journal of Communications.%

  Datacenters are large cyber-physical systems with continuous performance and

  non-ideal UPS system used to shave peak power demands. Our novel distributed
  battery control design has no performance impact, reduces the peak power
  needs, and accurately estimates and maximizes the battery lifetime. We
  demonstrate that models which do not take into account physical
  characteristics of batteries overestimate their lifetime by 2.4x. In
  contrast, our design is within 3.3% of the centralized battery control in
  terms of battery lifetime with 10x reduction in the communication costs,
  while shaving 23MWhrs/week of energy in a 10MW datacenter, equivalent to
  adding 8760 more servers at no additional power cost.%

  The development of a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is considered to be
  very important for peak shaving and power demand normalization, especially in

  cascade of an external controller that regulates the active and reactive
  power to generate reference currents and an internal current controller which
  produces gating signals for the inverter semiconductor switches. The proposed
  control algorithm takes the state of charge (SOC%) of the battery system into

  requirements of the SOC% limits of the batteries. System simulations are
  performed during discharging and charging modes of operation as well as
  during the active power command override mode for several power demand step

  \field{abstract}{%
  Grid connected energy storage systems are regarded as promising solutions for
  providing ancillary services to electricity networks and to play an important
  role in the development of smart grids. Thus far, the more mature battery
  technologies have been installed in pilot projects and studies have indicated
  their main advantages and shortcomings. The main concerns for wide adoption
  are the overall cost, the limited number of charging cycles (or lifetime),
  the depth of discharge, the low energy density and the sustainability of
  materials used. Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries (VRFB) are a promising option
  to mitigate many of these shortcomings, and demonstration projects using this
  technology are being implemented both in Europe and in the USA. This study
  presents a model using MATLAB/Simulink, to demonstrate how a VRFB based
  storage device can provide multi-ancillary services, focusing on frequency
  regulation and peak-shaving functions. The study presents a storage system at
  a medium voltage substation and considers a small grid load profile,
  originating from a residential neighbourhood and fast charging stations
  demand. The model also includes an inverter controller that provides a net
  power output from the battery system, in order to offer both services
  simultaneously. Simulation results show that the VRFB storage device can
  regulate frequency effectively due to its fast response time, while still
  performing peak-shaving services. VRFB potential in grid connected systems is
  discussed to increase awareness of decision makers, while identifying the
  main challenges for wider implementation of storage systems, particularly
  related to market structure and standardisation requirements. &copy; 2016

  The merits of electricity grid in Shanghai and sodium sulfur (NaS) storage

  BESS than onefold energy price mechanism while onefold capacity price
  mechanism is not suitable for NaS BESS. The discharge price of NaS BESS has

  Abstract The presented work focuses on energy management strategy, to operate
  a grid connected active \{PV\} system (APS) in a microgrid. A microgrid is a
  smart grid in a small scale which can be stand-alone or grid-tied. The
  proposed system is based on photovoltaic system, batteries and
  ultra-capacitors. Three converters are used to interface the elements of the
  \{APS\} to a common DC-link capacitor. The presented control strategy manages
  the power flow between the converters and the grid through the DC-link in
  order to maintain the grid power demand coming from the grid operator.
  Batteries are used as an energy source, to stabilize and permit the \{APS\}
  units to run at a constant and stable output power, damping peak surges in
  electricity demand and to store the excess of energy from the \{PV\} array.
  Ultra-capacitors are used as a fast power regulator to: limit the
  battery{\^a}â¬{\texttrademark}s current, regulate the DC-link voltage when
  the disconnection mode occurs and to deliver a smooth power to the grid,
  despite primary source and load fluctuations. Several operating modes are
  presented to manage locally the power flows between the various sources,
  taking into account the state of charge of batteries (SOC), the energy level
  of ultra-capacitors (Lev), the available \{PV\} power and the power demand
  from the grid operator.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  An extensive test has been conducted on a lithium-ion (Li-ion) cell under a
  variety of cycling conditions in order to evaluate factors that affect its
  cycle-life. The study is performed on a 900-mAh wound prismatic cell with
  contains a LiCoO2 positive electrode (cathode) and a synthetic graphite
  negative electrode (anode). Cycle-life is greatly influenced by the charge
  conditions, but is relatively insensitive to the discharge conditions. High
  charge cut-off voltages and a long float-charge period at 4.2 V or above have
  the most severe effects on cycle-life. Another damaging condition is high
  charge rates above the 1C rate, but reduction in the depth-of-discharge does
  not improve the cycle-life unlike the situation with other rechargeable
  batteries such as alkaline and lead--acid batteries. The dependence of the
  degradation rate on the charge voltage and the period of high charge voltage
  suggests that an electrochemical oxidation may be the cause.%
