# Project Introduction and Objectives

The announcement of the new £300million University of Bristol Campus in Temple Quarter \cite{November58:online}, presents an exciting new opportunity for digital innovations in sustainable energy. The government's 2020 smart meter rollout, is the first step for creating a smart energy grid. This is key for the UK to achieve a low-carbon, sustainable and efficient energy system for the future \cite{SmartEne79:online}. The UK's vision is mirrored in the University of Bristol's new strategy, as it seeks to boost its world-class research capacity and promote innovation in policy, to increase sustainability \cite{universi93:online}. The creation of a world-leading campus is an attractive means for the University to realise its vision. Consequently, the aim of this group project is to explore new digital technologies, to reduce both energy costs and energy usage to set a precedent in university campus sustainability.

Figure \ref{groupDia} describes the relationships between the individual project themes, where research in occupancy sensing, smart metering and building services will evaluate how energy usage in the new campus can be optimised. Projects looking at smart thermal grids, energy system interactions and peak demand reduction, analyse methods to reduce the university's energy costs; providing financial incentives to increase the campus' sustainability. The 5^th^ year group project will unite this research, creating a smart "brain" \cite{pbmeet} through combining usage data with new technologies and strategies, providing a business case to develop sustainable energy services on the new campus, pushing the University to meet it is carbon neutral 2030 goal \cite{universi93:online}.

## Individual Project Introduction

This project report investigates the feasibility of using energy storage systems (ESS) to reduce energy charges for the University of Bristol. This will be implemented in the new Temple Quarter campus, seeking to provide a comprehensive cost based analysis for investing in energy storage technology. By focusing on reducing charges related to peak demand, (periods where load on the grid is greatest \cite{WhatisPe67:online}) overall campus sustainability will rise. Within the project, the university’s energy profile and billing structure are analysed and simulated, which defines the bespoke energy requirements of the new campus. A comprehensive technology study of the different ESSs evaluated the feasibility of various systems, down-selecting the most appropriate battery for modelling. Through further evaluation of how the selected battery system would function, a model was designed to simulate battery system strategies. To find an optimum solution for the system's design concerning the system's capital cost against savings made from energy bills.

The overall outputs of the project for use in the $5^{th}$ year group design project are:

* _Cost Based Analysis Business Case_:  for investing in battery storage technology
* _Energy Profile Tool_:  to build and understand the new university campus’ Demand
* _Optimised Battery System Model_: producing best storage solutions based on energy profile tool

## Objectives

To achieve the projects outputs, the following detailed objectives were defined:

**Literature Review**
\begin{enumerate}
\item Perform a detailed literature review, and market analysis of current energy storage technologies and modelling conducted in evaluating using ESS to reduce peak energy demands, highlighting relevant techniques and limitations.
\item Investigate the applicability of different energy storage solutions for use in the University's new campus, comparing parameters such as; power-ratings, capacity, discharge times and costs to down-select a battery system for modelling.
\end{enumerate}

**Definition of System Strategies**
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item Define battery system strategies, establishing the key performance variables. This objective will include an investigation into measuring the performance of the battery system over time and evaluation of the best methods of using the battery.
\end{enumerate}

**Modelling and Analysis**
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item Analyse the university’s current peak demand charges; understanding the university’s current demand charge structure and collecting typical energy usage data.  
\item Create a tool to generate demand profile (kW) from half-hourly usage (kWh) data provided defining energy profile of the new campus.
\item Create a model simulating the use of battery strategies to change the energy demand profile of the new campus, comprising of three stages:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A simulation of using the battery system against a current university building, analysing the effect of the system for use as a datum.
\item A simulation of using the battery system in the new university campus
\item An assessment on the optimum battery design to select based on the new campus's energy profile
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

**Evaluation**
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item Evaluate results of the simulation, concluding on the effectiveness of different battery systems. A cost-based analysis will be used to measure the feasibility of the different energy storage systems for the university comparing the value of the system against current challenges in using the new technology.
\end{enumerate}
