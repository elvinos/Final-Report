# Aims and Objectives

The announcement of the new £300million University of Bristol Campus in Temple Quarter \cite{November58:online}, presents an exciting new opportunity for digital innovations in sustainable energy. The government's 2020 smart meter rollout, is the first step for creating a smart energy grid, key to achieving a low-carbon, sustainable and efficient energy for the UK \cite{SmartEne79:online}. The UK's vision corresponds to the University of Bristol's new strategy, seeking to boost its world-class research capacity and promote innovation in policy to increase sustainability \cite{universi93:online}. The creation of a world-leading sustainable digital campus is an attractive means for the University to achieve its vision. Consequently, the aim of this group project is to bring a explore of new digital technologies reducing both energy costs and energy usage, uniting these themes to set a new frontier in campus's sustainability.

Figure \ref{groupDia} shows how the separate subjects of the project are split, where research in Occupancy Sensing, Smart Metering and Building Services will evaluate how energy usage in the new campus can be optimised. Smart Thermal Grid, Energy Pricing and Peak Demand Reduction, all analyse methods of reducing the University's energy costs. Where new energy pricing structures coupled with peak demand reduction technologies, can reduce the load on the grid, helping support sustainable energies. The 5^th^ year group project will unite these themes, creating a smart "brain" through combining usage data with new technologies and strategies, providing a business case to develop sustainable energy services on the new campus, pushing the University to meet it's carbon neutral 2030 goal \cite{universi93:online}.

## Individual Project Aim

The aim of this individual project is to investigate the feasibility of using an energy storage system (ESS) to reduce charges related to peak energy demand for the University of Bristol, implemented in the new Temple Quarter campus. Within the project, the University’s peak demand charges will be analysed and simulated, modelling the bespoke energy requirements of the campus. Different peak-shaving system architectures will then be modelled against this usage and charge data, finding an optimum solution for the system's design concerning the system's capital cost against savings made from energy bills. This model will provide a comparison between using a decentralised system, for room by room use, or a centralised system, being applied to the whole building. The outputs of the project for 5^th^ year will be a flexible model which produces an optimum peak-shaving system architecture for a given University scenario, providing a cost benefit analysis of using energy storage.

## Objectives

**Literature Review**
\begin{enumerate}
\item Perform a detailed literature review, and market analysis of energy storage systems used to reduce peak energy demands, highlighting relevant modelling techniques and limitations.
\item Investigate different energy storage solutions, looking at their applicability to a University peak-shaving system, comparing parameters such as; power-ratings, discharge times, charge times and costs.
\end{enumerate}

**Definition of System Architectures**
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item Define peak-shaving system architectures, establishing the key performance variables. This objective will include an investigation of peak demand sensing, smart metering usage, energy storage health monitoring, energy conversion, methods to split supply between an energy storage system and the mains and a comparison between decentralised and centralised energy storage models.

\end{enumerate}

**Modelling and Analysis**
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item Analyse the University’s current peak demand charges; understanding the University’s current demand charge structure and collecting typical energy usage data. Parameters such as time of day and sources of energy peaks will be incorporated.
\item Produce a simulation to optimise the peak-shaving system, comparing metrics including; unit cost and reduction in peak kWh charges based on University billing structure. This model will provide a comparative analysis of the different system architectures. The model will detail savings against the University’s current peak demand charges, being comprised of three stages:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A simulation of the University's a normal energy use case and peak demand charges, for use as a datum.
\item Inclusion of energy storage systems, simulating logic and detailing any prediction methods.
\item An assessment of the use of peak load shedding, supply levelling and forecasting to improve the performance of the model.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

**Evaluation**
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item Evaluate results of the simulation, concluding on the effectiveness of different peak-shaving system architectures against particular scenarios. A cost-based analysis will be used to measure the feasibility of the different energy storage systems for the University.
\end{enumerate}
