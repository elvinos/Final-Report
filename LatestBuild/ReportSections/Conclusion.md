# Conclusions and Future Work

## Conclusions on Modelling Tool

* This project set out to create multiple tools that would be useful in both evaluating the value of a battery system whilst being flexible tools that can be used in the 5th year group project.
* _Energy Profile Tool:_  to build and understand the New University Campusâ€™s Demand
* _Optimised Battery System Model:_ producing best storage solutions based on energy profile tool
* _Business case:_ for battery technology investment



## Conclusions on Results

* Model confirms that it is financially feasible to purchase and use a battery to reduce energy bills
* Optimum battery can be selected using different values metrics based on the usage profile inputed.
* A 7 year payback period is lower than warranty on the battery, eliminating any risks in incorrectly modelling the batteries degradation
* After the battery has paid itself back there is nothing stopping it continuing to run until it ceases to function. Little maintenance is required after its is installed, so nearly all savings are instantly realised, this means the battery could theoretically continue to generate savings for the lifetime of the building (50 years)
* Due to the modular design of the Tesla Powerpack, after the system is initially installed it is feasible to swap the batteries out after they have worn out.
* The simulation is ran for a long period of time (25 years), there is a large amount of unpredictability particular in energy tariffs, that could dramatically alter the value of the battery system over it's life time. \hl{the sensitivity study showed.....}.

\hl{Refer Back To Challenges and Compare how these challenges are either overcome or still barriers}

* _Costs of Purchase too high_: the model proves that this barrier has been over come. As the battery will be purchased as an asset along with the buildings, land and other equipment that will be purchased for the new campus, it can be assumed that a very low interest rate will be taken on the battery.
* _Lifetime/ longevity of the battery too low_: Model of degradation shows that the lifetime of Li-ion is now feasible based on the battery being run in a controlled manner optimising it's longevity.
* _Frequent change of regulation and barriers to entry_: This is still the largest barrier to entry. Discussions with Western Power \cite{wpMWMD}, noted that DUoS prices are very likely to change over this period. Due to the added flexibility that fast frequency response energy storage methods such as Li-ion batteries bring, it is in the energy suppliers interest to encourage customer to purchase this technology rather than penalise this. Much of further change in regulation may therefore support using Li-ion batteries, which could increase the batteries value further in the future.
* _Negative environmental effects:_  \hl{expand further using references } \cite{daniels2013financial}
* _Technology still maturing_, Li-ion batteries have not been used in this manner before, for extended periods of time. However Tesla has been using batteries for over 10 years and has gathered some of the best minds to understand how their batteries will function. A lot of research around Li-ion has been conducted showing that on a smaller scale the technology is mature enough. The nature of scaling should have no additional effects on the batteries performance. As the way in which the battery will be operated is well modelled, using strategies working in the batteries design parameters no undesired load scenarios should be place on the battery.

## Future Work

* Can apply this model directly into 5th year, using the data tool to understand energy demand on a range of different sources including heat and gas. Transferrable to evaluating smart thermal grids with the use of CHP
* Further development of the degradation model and testing, to validate assumptions, work to be completed with Tesla
* Evaluate other methods such as frequency response to determine if additional value can be created
* Model the value of having a fixed demand profile for the new campus could have in reducing it's connection fee (there will be large upfront costs incurred on building the supply lines for the new campus, if this can be reduced by using batteries, how much could be saved ?)
