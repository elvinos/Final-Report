# Background and Summary of Key Work and References

The following literature review provides an overview of using Energy Storage Systems (ESS) to lower energy costs. Using batteries in this manner is still novel, with a broad range of ESSs and use strategies available for evaluation; each producing dramatically different results when placed in different situations. By building a comprehensive understanding of the technology and new campus situation, an optimised energy storage system can be found, providing a full understanding of the value energy storage could bring to the new university campus.

## Sustainability and Energy Storage Systems

The UK's energy grid uses many methods of providing the power required to meet the country's demand. This energy comes from both clean (hydro, wind solar etc.) and dirty (coal, gas etc.) sources. Due to the nature of most clean technologies, these sources are used to meet the UK's base load (power usage during off-peak periods) \cite{GBNation22:online}. Periods of the day when energy usage is higher, (called peak demand) additional fast-acting dirty sources like combined cycle gas turbines are switched-on to meet this demand \cite{Reducing94:online}. Peak demand periods are charged much more significantly, for this reason. An ESS proposes a new way to level out these peak periods, reducing the need for fast, responsive dirty technologies. By using energy storage technologies the University could reduce their emissions by up to 360gCO2 per kWh \cite{Part1Att26:online}, while having the potential to save a significant amount of money.

## University Energy Charges
The University of Bristol's infrastructure spans across three sites; the City Centre, Stoke Bishop and Langford. Across these locations, the majority of facilities receive separate energy bills, allowing some granularity in the understanding energy charges originate from\cite{Jbrentmeet}. The University receives charges bundled together under four distinct themes \cite{Jbrentmeet}, described below, where their applicability to energy storage technology is discussed.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Unit Charge} - Base cost of energy consumption, making up 58\% of the bill.
\item \textbf{Distribution Use of System (DUoS)} - Including capacity charge and DUoS rate.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{DUoS Rate} - there are three DUoS rates, Green, Amber and Red \footcite[\label{unitbill}See page 27 of][25.405 p/kWh in Red, against 0.147p/kWh in Green]{SWEB201492:online}, depending on the time of day. Energy costs during Red periods are significantly higher (between 5pm-7pm). For Western Power (University's current supplier), there is a 17000\% increase in price during these periods \footref{unitbill}. Reducing DUoS rate charges is the main method of reducing peak demand charges; an ESS should be used during Red periods and charged during Green periods. These make up ~20\% of the bill \footnote{\label{bill}See Figure \ref{Development-38} in Appendix}.
\item \textbf{Capacity Charge} - this is where the customer sets their maximum demand (kW) level\cite{Deconstr52:online}. This is set above the actual maximum demand of a building, to reduce the risk of breaching this threshold. If breached, the customer incurs substantial penalties, and the supplier increases the threshold for the next billing period. By levelling off peaks in energy demand, the capacity charge threshold can decrease. Capacity charges make up a 4\% of the monthly bill \footref{bill} where the risk surpassing the threshold exceeds any savings seen through implementing an ESS.
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Transmission Network Use of System (TNUoS)} - Three times of the year when the UK's energy demand is greatest, called TRIADs. These dates lie between November and February, separated by at least ten days in each financial year \cite{TriadsWh7:online}. The average max peak demand (kW) across the three TRIADS \cite{TNUoSTra99:online}, is multiplied by a tariff \cite{TNUoScha93:online}; added to the customer's end of year bill. The University has become quite good at forecasting these periods \cite{Jbrentmeet}, making it possible to schedule an ESS to reduce demand during these periods where power supply rate (kW) is crucial. These make up 7\% of the monthly bill \footref{bill}.
\item \textbf{Feed-In Tariff (FIT)} - Based on feeding back energy to the grid. Dependent on the battery system selected, there is potential to increases the value of the ESS by leveraging this charge. This charge is highly complex and frequently changing so will not be evaluated in this project.
\end{enumerate}

## Current Peak Demand Management Methods

Peak demand reduction is synonymous with peak shaving; the ability to control energy usage during intervals of high demand, to limit or reduce demand charges \cite{schneiderRECPS}, \cite{baldorPS}. Traditionally there are two methods for reducing peak demand for industrial complexes \cite{schneiderRECPS}. These are:

**Load Shedding**: This is reducing energy usage, by switching off certain systems during periods of peak demand \cite{6199851}. An intelligent scheduling system or a simple forecasting tool can be used to execute load shedding \cite{Reducing37:online}, where systems are switched off autonomously or manually. Often load shedding is calculated daily using a schedule to set a fixed maximum energy limit  \cite{6938948}.

* *Limitations*: Forecasting errors can significantly reduce the effectiveness of this system, where reactive methods are often better \cite{6938948}. Getting university staff and students to shift their usage habits from peak times could be potentially costly \cite{Jbrentmeet}, highlighted in experiments conducted by the University of Copenhagen \cite{copenmeet}.

**On-site Generation**: Adding off-the-grid capacity to the consumer \cite{schneiderRECPS}. The University currently uses diesel generators  roughly ten times a year to reduce TRIAD charges; supported by \cite{shen2016}. Due to the environmental impact of using diesel generators, an ESS would act as an improved replacement for this method for reducing TRIAD charges.

* *Limitations*: The University currently has 0.5MW of PhotoVoltaic (PV) installed using nearly all available space \cite{Jbrentmeet}. These PV's provide only 0.5\% of the total energy demand, meaning the use of on-site generation to offset peak demand has a negligible effect in flattening the University's demand. Pairing batteries with PV as a method of supply levelling appears unfeasible in the context of the University.

**University Research**: IODICUS, is a current University project, looking at reducing energy costs, by improving the amount of sensing data around the university's usage. This project produced middleware for an IoT deployment of energy sensors/actuators, and software to explore the resulting ‘big data’ of the sensors \cite{priestemail}. Although the project did not evaluate using ESSs, the outcome of improving sensing data will help to improve the chosen ESS performance.

There are a limited number of commercially available solutions that use ESSs to reduce peak loads directly. ABB offers energy-storage, smart-grid, products which perform load levelling at grid level \cite{abbpeakshave}. These systems are designed primarily for supply levelling, using forecasting methods and extensive ESSs to offset excess energy supply produced from renewable energies \cite{5559470}, rather than focusing on reducing its customer's energy bills. One Cycle Control have created technologies to regulate peak-load and mitigate peak demand charges for commercial/industrial facilities using Li-ion batteries \cite{peakload38:online}. The technologies proved effective at reducing peak demand charges, but highlight the steep cost of the ESSs reduce the system's financial feasibility \cite{Demonstr51:online}. Based on there being no direct commercial solution this report sets to understand the components required to create an effective energy storage solution for reducing the university's new campus energy bills.

## Peak Shaving Systems Literature Review
Acknowledging limitations in commercial peak-shaving ESSs, it is crucial to understand current research in using ESS technology to design an efficient system. Research is grouped, highlighting each section's significance and relevance to the development of the model.

### Forecasting and the Use of ESS in Load Shifting
Using energy price forecasts, an ESS can be switched on to shift energy costs; purchasing energy at a cheaper rate, using this energy during peak times. \cite{7555795} ran simulations to test NaS, Li-ion and Flow batteries, for an Italian commercial plant, failed to find viable return on investment (ROI)\cite{7555795}.\cite{5590194} used real hourly spot prices to decide the best times to turn on and off Vanadium Redox Batteries (VRB) and Polysulfide Bromide Batteries (PSB). Through sequential quadratic programming (SQP), battery sizes were optimised, finding PSB's had a business case for load shifting. These two conflicting results were due to the sensitivity in energy pricing. An independent investigation of this technique with the University, may prove feasible. \cite{Bennett2015122} added a real-time operator to create an intelligent scheduling system for home prediction. This system significantly improved the state of charge of the battery, freeing more energy for use in reducing peaks, highlighting that forecasts combined with real-time information can increase the performance of the system further. Modelling development will research:

* the implications of battery health on the lifetime value of the battery, for the battery selected
*  increasing granularity in the University's usage data will to incorportate a real-time operator

### Supply Levelling
Supply levelling is the most common use for ESS \cite{iearoadmapes}, using large batteries to reduce power fluctuations brought by the use of renewable technologies \cite{7324861}, \cite{7564619}. Supply levelling works by storing excess supply, reducing peaks in the grid rather than in demand. \cite{Allik20161116} looked at improving supply for a residential home. Shiftable water heating was identified to account for 50% of household electricity use, so was used as the primary storage device. Excess load from wind turbines was used to heat water in excess supply periods bypassing an inverter improved energy losses \cite{Leadbetter2012685}. Minimising conversion through inverters makes a large difference in the efficiency of the system. Supply levelling will not be addressed in this model due to the University's PV's contributing to only 0.5\% of its supply [@Jbrentmeet].

### Battery Sizing and Financial Modelling
There are numerous studies, analysing the business cases for ESSs. \cite{7555795} and \cite{7555793} model the use ESSs broadly, to reduce the cost of all energy charges, revealing that the ROI is unlikely to be feasible beyond 2020. Papers including \cite{1300158} and \cite{6175723} evaluated financial models for particular case studies, showing that bespoke solutions achieved greater peak shaving reductions than returns promised by current generic products \cite{abbpeakshave}. \cite{7555795}, \cite{7555793}, \cite{1300158}, \cite{6175723} and \cite{20164002874437} all present a strong arguments that a bespoke solution for the University will provide a better business case for ESS than generic commercial technology.

Investigating the benefits of a decentralised system, reducing peaks on a small scale rather than using one large central ESS,  \cite{6604477} analysed both peak shaving and battery longevity for a large data centre.  Through both experimentation and modelling,  \cite{6604477} showed that when regarding the batteries lifespan, the ability to regulate load through a series of batteries can be more favourable than a centralised system. Research conducted by \cite{6348200} and \cite{Demonstr51:online} also both support using a decentralised system.

\cite{20160601898032}, \cite{Levron201280} and \cite{5371839} show methods ways of optimising battery configurations. \cite{5371839}, used a non-numeric modelling method, focusing on ultra-capacitors to find the optimal ESS. The results emphasised the constraint of storage capacity, showing an exponential decrease in value gained after a particular size of ESS. Finding the required battery size and power for the new campus will be the primary focus of this project's model. \cite{Levron201280} created an analytical model, using energy bands to regulate peak load, giving an optimum storage size for a given system; this was a straightforward and efficient method of modelling battery usage. The model will incorporate:

* An adaption of \cite{20160601898032} modelling technique to find the optimal configuration of the ESS
* An assessment a decentralised battery system, focusing primarily on lab space

## Comparison of Energy Storage Systems

The selected ESS will govern the cost and feasibility of a peak shaving system. An ESS converts electrical energy into a form stored for later use \cite{Chen2009291}.  Electrochemical batteries characterise low maintenance, high round-trip efficiency, long cycle lives and high energy density's; arguably being the most appropriate technology for peak shaving \cite{liao2016a}, \cite{Dunn928}. Batteries, therefore, have been chosen as the main focus for this study. The various storage methods can be characterised for different uses summaries below:

* **Energy Management:** for large scale storage, typically used by power plants for load levelling and ramping/load following.
    * Pumped Hydroelectric Storage (PHS), Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) and Cryogenic Energy Storage (CES) are the conventional technologies for high generation above 100MW. All these methods are on a scale too large to be considered for this project.
    * Large-scale batteries, flow batteries, fuel cells, solar fuels, CES and Thermal Energy Storage (TES) are suitable for medium-scale energy management with capacities of 10 – 100 MW. These technologies are too large and their frequency response is too slow for this application.
* **Power quality:** fast response times improve power quality allowing techniques such as the instantaneous voltage drop, flicker mitigation and short duration uninterrupted power supply
    * Flywheels, Batteries, Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storages (SMES), capacitors and ultra-capacitors have millisecond response time lower for storage sizes less than 1 MW - suitable in addition to large scale battery.
* **Bridging power:** Relatively fast response (< 1 s) but also have relatively long discharge time (hours). The typical power rating for these types of applications is about 100 kW – 10 MW.
    * Batteries, flow batteries \cite{flowbatstan}, fuel cells and Metal-Air Cells\cite{Chen2009291}, \cite{batuni}. These are the most appropriate ESS type for application.

By removing energy storage methods that would not be appropriate for the system a table was created \footnote{See table \ref{battabs}, in the Appendices} comparing ESSs. Batteries along with capacitors provide the response time \cite{Choudar201521} and efficiencies required to make the system justifiable, where only rechargeable batteries were compared.

## Battery Selection - Tesla Powerpack 2

Due to the maturity of the technology, the fast frequency response in delivering power, Li-ion batteries were down-selected as the most viable option for achieving the project's aims. EOS and BYD and Tesla are currently the only companies that supply Li-ion batteries of an appropriate size. Due readiness in information around performance and price, the Tesla Powerpack 2 was chosen for this model, to improve the validity of results.
